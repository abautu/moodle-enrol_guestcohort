# Guest Cohort 

## What is it?
Guest Cohort is an enrolment plugin for Moodle that mixes the features 
from guest enrolment with those of cohort sync. More exactly, it allows 
you to provide quest access to a users that belong to a particular 
cohort. These users will be able to view these the resources of the 
course, but will not be able to take part in its activities (they can 
not complete assignments, they can not take quizes, they will not show 
in participants lists, they will not get emails from News forums, etc).

## Where to use it?

You can use it to give guest access to a course to a group of users, 
without leaving your course open to all guests and without requiring you
to giveout password or them to enter passwords.

On example is when you have cohorts of students organized by year of 
study: 1st Year, 2nd Year, etc. You allow each year to participate in 
their courses, most likely using Cohort sync enrolment instances. So 
1st year students participate in courses for 1st year, 2nd year 
students participate in courses for 2nd year and so on. This is what 
you can do with Moodle core. If you install this plugin, you can give 
students guest access to courses from previous year. For example, in 
courses for 1st year you also add Guest Cohort enrolment instances for 
2nd Year cohorts. This will allow 2nd year students to view resources 
from previous year, either to study for postponed exams or to refresh 
their knowledge. They will do this in guest mode, a "silent" mode that 
will not bother teachers and students from 1st Year.
